Introduction
============

MailChimp (http://mailchimp.com) integration for Plone.

Right now this is an experimental package only. If you are looking for a
MailChimp integration for Plone have a look at raptus.mailchimp (http://plone.org/products/raptus.mailchimp).

The difference between raptus.mailchimp and collective.mailchimp is that it
uses z3c.form instead of formlib for forms and plone.app.registry instead of
portal_properties for storing properties.

collective.mailchimp is tested on Plone 4.x and should work on Plone > 3.3
(with the appropriate version pins).
